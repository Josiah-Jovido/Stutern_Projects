# Stutern_Projects
This repository contains all the Bi-weekly challenges i went through in stutern.

## Biweekly Challenge 1
This python script was written using pycharm but it can be run on any text editor/IDE that supports python script.
The purpose of this script is to collect input from a user and intelligently display the results.
The script prompts for a users name, age and gender, and prints out the user's name and age according to the gender input.
It also calculates the user date of birth from the age and prints it out, stating the age group the user belongs to, the age of the user a decade ago, and the user's age in the next 50 years per decade interval.

## Biweekly Challenge 2
The objective of this challenge was to build a regressor that recommends the crew member size for potential ship buyers. I used numpy, scipy, pandas, sklearn libraries for combatting this task, the dataset used for building my model can be found in the repo.
#### Methodology
* Read the file and display columns.
* Calculating basic statistics of the data (count, mean, std, etc), examining the data and stating my observations.
* Selection of columns important to predict crew size.
* Creating training and testing sets (60% training and remainder for testing).
* Building a machine learning model to predict the crew size.
* Calculating Pearson correlation coefficient for the training set and testing data sets.
* Overfitting, and How Can You Avoid It? 
* Difference between bias and variance?
* Classification over Regression?
